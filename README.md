AnCH Framework - Another C++ Hack "Framework"

AnCH framework aims to provide utility classes for some common programming features. Features are implemented to be used as simply as possible.
This framework was initially a way to test new C++ specifications (C++11) and to test C++ design patterns and tricks.
Only POSIX systems are supported for now. Others could be supported later.

(Partial) Doxygen documentation can be found on [project home page](https://vlachenal.github.io/anch-framework/).
